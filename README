This plugin requires special hudson setup to work.

1. Skype must be running as the same user as the hudson server
2. If running hudson on a 64bit JDK you must add a windows slave running on a 32bit jdk
3. If running hudson on a anything but windows add a windows slave running on a 32bit jdk
4. The slave must have a "skype" label
5. Check the logs to see if it connects ok to skype
6. If it connects ok, then you must allow the java plugin to connect with skype
7. Add skypeid to all users in hudson
8. Good luck
